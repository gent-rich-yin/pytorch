UBSan:
The gcc -fsanitize=undefined flag enables the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan) in GCC. 
UBSan is a runtime error detection tool that instruments your code during compilation to detect various types of undefined behavior as your program executes.

PIC:
Position Independent Code

CMake find_package:
The find_package command in CMake is used to locate and load settings from an external project or library. 
It's a fundamental command for managing dependencies in CMake-based projects.

CMake case-sensitivity:
variable is, command is not

CMAKE heck_type_size:
The check_type_size command in CMake is used to determine the size of a C/C++ type or expression during the configure step. 
This is crucial for ensuring code portability across different platforms and compilers, as the size of certain types (like int) can vary.
include(CheckTypeSize)

CMAKE macro command:
In CMake, the macro command is used to define a block of commands that can be invoked later as a single command. 
It allows for code reusability and can simplify complex CMake scripts.

CMAKE execute_process command:
execute_process(COMMAND "which" "python3" RESULT_VARIABLE _exitcode OUTPUT_VARIABLE _py_exe)

CMake string command:
string(STRIP ${_py_exe} Python_EXECUTABLE)

CMake Interface imported library:
add_library(pybind::pybind11 INTERFACE IMPORTED)

CMake find_package_handle_standard_args
find_package_handle_standard_args(OpenTelemetryApi
    FOUND_VAR OpenTelemetryApi_FOUND
    REQUIRED_VARS OpenTelemetryApi_INCLUDE_DIRS
